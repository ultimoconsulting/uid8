            <div class="answer">
              <p>“Hell Week” means that the Coach instructs you to do 3 very large training sessions in one Coach week. This is a high volume week and it was designed to be tough and push you. Please organize your training days so that you have at least one day of rest between each Hell Week Coach session. A good idea would be to perform the first session on Monday, then have a rest day, the second session on Wednesday, followed by a rest day with the final session on Friday.</p>
              <p>However, you should listen to your body and ensure you are not pushing yourself too hard during this week. After conquering Hell Week, the next week is a lower volume week. This will allow you to recover from the Hell Week, and prepare you to step up into the next training cycle.</p>
